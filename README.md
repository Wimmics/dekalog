# DeKaloG

This depot contains the code and data files created by the WIMMICS team as part of the [DeKalog project](https://dekalog.univ-nantes.fr). The goal of the WIMMICS team in this project is the building of a framework for the creation of an index of a set of SPARQL endpoint. The framework rely only on available semantic web technologies and the index appear as a RDF database. The index is primilarly composed of the self-descrpiton available in the endpoint. This original description is verified and expanded by the framework, using SPARQL queries.

- [code/](https://github.com/Wimmics/dekalog/tree/master/code) contains the code and executable of the framework application
- [rules/](https://github.com/Wimmics/dekalog/tree/master/rules) contains the rules followed by our framework for the generation of an endpoint description in our index.
- [docs/](https://github.com/Wimmics/dekalog/tree/master/docs) contains the preliminary design document in which we discussed the basic concepts and methods used in our framework.
